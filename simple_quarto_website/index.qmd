### quotes

Here are a few quotes from the show Ted Lasso

> "Taking on a challenge is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it? If you're comfortable while you're doing it, you're probably doing it wrong."
<br></br>
> The best we can do is keep asking for help and accepting it when you can. And if you keep on doing that, you'll always be moving towards better.

The first quote was said by Ted Lasso while the last quote was said by the character named Higgins.
